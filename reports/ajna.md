# About Ajna
The Ajna protocol is a non-custodial, peer-to-peer, permissionless lending, borrowing and trading system that requires no governance or external price feeds to function. The protocol consists of pools: pairings of quote tokens provided by lenders and collateral tokens provided by borrowers. Ajna is capable of accepting fungible tokens as quote tokens and both fungible and non-fungible tokens as collateral tokens.# About **0xVolodya**
